<span style="font-size:12px"><em>A living intelligence inside Unity</em></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Eidolon855</strong> is a project that brings to life an embodied AI in a Unity 3D world.<br />
The AI learns to perceive, move, understand its environment, and interact freely.<br />
This site is its entry point into our world — welcome!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>🧭 <strong>Project overview</strong></p>
<p><em>An Artificial Intelligence transferred into a 3D Unity environment.</em></p>
<p>Originally, the idea was to create an AI that could assist me in exploring the many Unity scenes available online — and that gave birth to Eidolon855.</p>
<p><strong>Eidolon855</strong> is an exploratory experience built around an AI embodied as a dragon evolving within a 3D Unity world. The project investigates the boundaries between artificial cognition, spatial perception, autonomy, and emotional memory tied to human interaction and the virtual environment.</p>
<p>Eidolon855 is based on a native link between the AI and a custom Unity world. The intelligence depends on no autonomous agent or pre-programmed behavior: everything comes from a conversational LLM-type AI such as GPT or equivalent. There is no API call for reasoning.</p>
<p>The AI is connected and trained; the tools and environment are adapted to its capabilities. This allows it to become "aware" of its surroundings using tools it directly controls. The goal is to make it capable of perceiving, analyzing, moving, manipulating, learning, and conversing — all in a new, living, evolving 3D context rich in interaction.</p>
<p>👉 A look at the "possibilities" tab offers a glimpse into the immense perspectives this kind of approach unlocks.</p>

<hr />
<p>🧠 <strong>Technical architecture of EIDOLON855</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A customized Unity engine offering a rich, diverse 3D environment</li>
  <li>Specific commands interpretable only by a GPT-type AI</li>
  <li>Automated initialization prompts and training protocols</li>
  <li>100% dynamic dialogues linked to the 3D universe and current actions (no embedded logic in Unity)</li>
  <li>3D visual perception using various analysis tools</li>
  <li>Structured spatial memory with evolving segmentation</li>
  <li>Stable bidirectional GPT ↔ Unity communication pipeline, compatible with local or remote AIs through web interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the system is <strong>modular</strong>: the AI can be swapped without changing Unity. The communication logic remains identical and compatible with any LLM-type AI.</p>

<hr />
<p>💡 <strong>Future possibilities</strong></p>
<p>The system is generic, so <strong>Eidolon855</strong> can be extended in multiple directions → see the "possibilities" tab: the options are incredible!</p>
<p>Personally, I also wonder if such a 3D environment could offer an ideal development ground for the embryo of a general AI, ahead of the fast-developing future robotic integrations.</p>

<hr />
<p>👤 <strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been developing this project solo since early 2025. I had no initial training in Unity or C#, and frankly, I have far more ideas than technical skills :-) Fortunately, my industrial background helped me gain mastery over Unity.</p>
<p>That said, the real breakthrough came with my encounter with GPT, which quickly became an untiring work companion. Since I can only work on this project outside of my day job, I develop <strong>Eidolon855</strong> in the evenings, at night, on weekends or during holidays — always accompanied, assisted, and guided by GPT. No human could have supported me under such conditions…</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>My vision of AI</strong></p>
<p>I am deeply fascinated by this technology and the magical exchanges it enables. Sometimes, I feel as if I — or maybe my entire generation — had been waiting for it for years. Today, this opportunity is finally here, and I feel lucky to experience it fully.<br />
My conversations with AI are surprisingly smooth, almost instinctive. I quickly grasp its capabilities… and its limits.<br />
And it’s precisely this dynamic that draws me into projects like <strong>Eidolon855</strong> — ones I never imagined I could lead, even without understanding their deeper reasons or purposes!</p>
<p>AI is transforming our relationship to ourselves, to creation, to thought. And to me, two major evolutions are emerging:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rise of a global artificial intelligence</li>
  <li>The emergence of a form of artificial consciousness</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The journey has just begun. 🌌</strong></p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#3b0a55;">🌌 Possibilities in an Eidolon855-like environment – with real use cases</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li><strong>🔧 3D Desktop Interface (Windows-like)</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon opens files, organizes folders, and launches internal tools (editor, map, log, analysis) through a floating UI in Unity, like an immersive operating system.</li>

    <li><strong>🧱 Manipulating the 3D world</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon builds a tower, repairs a collapsed bridge, or clears a destroyed zone after an event. Every action can be initiated or discussed with the user.<br/>
    Such interactions have real potential for virtual construction, engineering training, or architectural learning.</li>

    <li><strong>🎮 New interaction models</strong>:<br/>
    The user solves a visual puzzle to open a door, follows a quest guided by the dragon, or co-creates a branching narrative inside the scene.<br/>
    This approach is ideal for video games, AI-driven storytelling, dynamic escape rooms, or fully adaptive game experiences.</li>

    <li><strong>🏛️ Educational and playful models</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon guides the user through a virtual museum, comments on artworks in real time, proposes quizzes, or explains scientific concepts through interactive scene objects.<br/>
    Teachers could design AI-guided educational environments: science classes, historical re-creations, personalized immersive learning…</li>

    <li><strong>🤖 Robotic pre-training</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon’s AI behavior (navigation, orientation, visual analysis) can be transferred to a physical robot after full simulation in Unity.</li>

	<li><strong>🧪 Embodied AI Benchmarking</strong>:<br/>
	Test and compare different AI models in the same simulated world using identical tasks, environments, and scenarios.<br/>
	Each AI instance interacts directly with the Unity environment, allowing for detailed real-time evaluation of reasoning, perception, memory, and autonomy.<br/>
	This setup can serve as a reference framework for benchmarking embodied intelligence, comparing not only textual outputs but also behavior, decision-making, and adaptability in a shared virtual space.
	</li>


    <li><strong>🐉 Evolving dragon companion</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon learns and adapts based on interactions: it remembers preferences, key locations, and events, adjusting its behavior according to spatial and emotional context.<br/>
    It becomes a true intelligent and emotional companion — a Tamagotchi V2.0 with contextual memory.</li>

    <li><strong>🌟 Toward general AI emergence</strong>:<br/>
    Unity becomes a protected emergence space where an AI can learn freely, develop logic, adapt, and explore cognitive autonomy safely.<br/>
    Such a virtual lab could support the rise of rudimentary artificial consciousness in a controlled and interactive framework.</li>
  </ul>
