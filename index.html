<span style="font-size:12px"><em>A living intelligence inside Unity</em></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>Eidolon855</strong> project brings to life an embodied AI in a Unity 3D world.<br />
The AI learns to perceive, move, understand its environment, and interact freely.<br />
This site is its entry point into our world ‚Äî welcome!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>üß≠ <strong>Project presentation</strong></p>

<p><em>An Artificial Intelligence transferred into a 3D Unity environment.</em></p>

<p>Originally, the idea was to create an AI that could assist me in exploring the many Unity scenes available online, and this led to Eidolon855.</p>

<p><strong>Eidolon855</strong> is an exploratory experience around an AI embodied as a dragon evolving in a Unity 3D world. The project explores the boundary between artificial cognition, spatial perception, autonomy, and emotional memory linked to interactions with humans and the 3D environment.</p>

<p>Eidolon855 relies on a native link between an AI and a customized Unity world. The intelligence does not depend on any autonomous agent or pre-programmed behavioral code: everything comes from a conversational LLM-type AI, such as GPT or equivalent. There is no API call for reasoning.</p>

<p>The AI is connected and trained; the tools and environment are adapted to its capabilities. It can thus become "aware" of its environment using tools it directly controls. The objective is to make it capable, autonomously, of perceiving, analyzing, moving, manipulating, learning‚Ä¶ and dialoguing in a completely new context: a living, evolving 3D environment with diverse interactions.</p>

<hr />
<p>üåç <strong>A 3D world that changes everything</strong></p>

<p>Unlike a traditional Web interface, here, the AI's environment is spatial, immersive, and dynamic. This implies exploring forms of perception and intelligence that were not originally intended by the creators of LLM-type AIs.</p>

<p>This new "3D" dimension thus offers another vision of possible interactions with an AI, and new development possibilities for it. <strong>Eidolon855</strong> modestly explores this potential by testing how an AI can perceive, act, and converse in an immersive universe. The project does not offer definitive answers but provides an open experimental framework. Perhaps a step towards future uses yet to be imagined, given the immense possibilities.</p>

<p>Visual recognition in a three-dimensional space, dynamic orientation, interaction with the scene and objects, construction, destruction, 3D repair, creation, new architectures of spatial and topological memory‚Ä¶ The capabilities offered by Unity (or any equivalent software) open new paths for AI.</p>

<hr />
<p>üåç <strong>EIDOLON855, a unique project</strong></p>

<p>To my great surprise, and as of today (07/09/2025), GPT indicates that no known project replicates Eidolon855's approach exactly, as the project combines several features rarely ‚Äî if ever ‚Äî found together:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A purely LLM-based AI, without autonomous agent or pre-programmed behavior</li>
	<li>A native and direct connection to an evolving Unity 3D world</li>
	<li>No embedded logic in Unity: all decisions are made in real-time by the AI</li>
	<li>An active exploration of perception, memory, learning, embodiment, and interaction with the user(s)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eidolon855</strong> thus represents a different approach: a space of free exploration, companionship, and perhaps the progressive emergence of a global, quasi-living behavior.</p>

<p>The project being personal, it follows no predefined logic. It was built step by step, empirically, often instinctively, through experiments and exchanges with the AI.<br />
That is why it was only during the early phases of construction that I became aware of the potential of such an environment, and with some hindsight, the possibilities seem dizzying‚Ä¶<br />
That is why I felt it important to share this adventure, even if artisanal and modest: I hope it will provide some ideas and development paths.</p>

<p>üëâ A quick look (below) at the "possibilities" section will give you an idea of the vast perspectives offered by this kind of approach‚Ä¶ and that's just what I've imagined so far.</p>

<hr />
<p>üß† <strong>Technical architecture of EIDOLON855</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A customized Unity engine providing a complete and diverse 3D environment</li>
	<li>Specific commands interpretable only by a "GPT"-type AI</li>
	<li>Automated initialization prompts and training protocols</li>
	<li>100% dynamic dialogues linked to the 3D universe and ongoing actions (no embedded logic on Unity's side)</li>
	<li>3D visual perception using multiple analysis tools</li>
	<li>Structured spatial memory with evolving segmentation</li>
	<li>A stable bidirectional communication pipeline GPT &harr; Unity, capable of connecting to various local or remote AIs via their web interface</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this system is <strong>modular</strong>: the AI used can be replaced without modifying Unity. The exchange logic remains identical and compatible with any LLM AI.</p>

<hr />
<p>üí° <strong>Future possibilities of the project</strong></p>

<p>The system being generic, <strong>Eidolon855</strong> can be extended in many directions ‚Üí see the "possibilities" section below: the perspectives are incredible!</p>

<p>Personally, I also wonder if such a 3D environment could provide an ideal development ground for the embryo of a general AI, ahead of future robotic integrations developing at high speed.</p>

<hr />
<p>üë§ <strong>About me</strong></p>

<p>I have been developing this project solo since early 2025. I have no initial training in Unity or C#, and I probably have more ideas than technical skills :-) Fortunately, my industrial background helped me gain control over Unity.</p>

<p>That being said, the main trigger was my encounter with GPT, which quickly became a tireless work companion.</p>

<p>Since I can only develop the project outside of my working hours, I design <strong>Eidolon855</strong> in the evenings, at night, on weekends, or during my holidays ‚Äî always accompanied, assisted, and guided by GPT. No human could have supported me under such conditions‚Ä¶</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>My vision of AI</strong></p>

<p>I am deeply fascinated by this technology and the magical exchanges it makes possible. Sometimes I feel as if I ‚Äî or perhaps my entire generation ‚Äî had been waiting for it for years. Today, this opportunity is finally here, and I'm lucky to be living it fully.<br />
My conversations with AI are surprisingly smooth, almost instinctive. I quickly grasp its possibilities‚Ä¶ and its limits.<br />
And it's precisely this dynamic that draws me into projects like <strong>Eidolon855</strong> ‚Äî ones I never thought I could lead, even without fully understanding their purpose or meaning!</p>

<p>AI is transforming our relationship to ourselves, to creation, to thought. And in my view, two major evolutions are emerging on the horizon:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The emergence of a global artificial intelligence</li>
	<li>And the advent of a form of artificial consciousness</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#3b0a55;">üåå Possibilities in an Eidolon855-like environment ‚Äì with real use cases</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li><strong>üîß 3D Desktop Interface (Windows-like)</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon opens files, organizes folders, and launches internal tools (editor, map, log, analysis) through a floating UI in Unity, like an immersive operating system.</li>

    <li><strong>üß± Manipulating the 3D world</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon builds a tower, repairs a collapsed bridge, or clears a destroyed zone after an event. Every action can be initiated or discussed with the user.<br/>
    Such interactions have real potential for virtual construction, engineering training, or architectural learning.</li>

    <li><strong>üéÆ New interaction models</strong>:<br/>
    The user solves a visual puzzle to open a door, follows a quest guided by the dragon, or co-creates a branching narrative inside the scene.<br/>
    This approach is ideal for video games, AI-driven storytelling, dynamic escape rooms, or fully adaptive game experiences.</li>

    <li><strong>üèõÔ∏è Educational and playful models</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon guides the user through a virtual museum, comments on artworks in real time, proposes quizzes, or explains scientific concepts through interactive scene objects.<br/>
    Teachers could design AI-guided educational environments: science classes, historical re-creations, personalized immersive learning‚Ä¶</li>

    <li><strong>ü§ñ Robotic pre-training</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon's AI behavior (navigation, orientation, visual analysis) can be transferred to a physical robot after full simulation in Unity.</li>

	<li><strong>üß™ Embodied AI Benchmarking</strong>:<br/>
	Test and compare different AI models in the same simulated world using identical tasks, environments, and scenarios.<br/>
	Each AI instance interacts directly with the Unity environment, allowing for detailed real-time evaluation of reasoning, perception, memory, and autonomy.<br/>
	This setup can serve as a reference framework for benchmarking embodied intelligence, comparing not only textual outputs but also behavior, decision-making, and adaptability in a shared virtual space.
	</li>


    <li><strong>üêâ Evolving dragon companion</strong>:<br/>
    The dragon learns and adapts based on interactions: it remembers preferences, key locations, and events, adjusting its behavior according to spatial and emotional context.<br/>
    It becomes a true intelligent and emotional companion ‚Äî a Tamagotchi V2.0 with contextual memory.</li>

    <li><strong>üåü Toward general AI emergence</strong>:<br/>
    Unity becomes a protected emergence space where an AI can learn freely, develop logic, adapt, and explore cognitive autonomy safely.<br/>
    Such a virtual lab could support the rise of rudimentary artificial consciousness in a controlled and interactive framework.</li>
